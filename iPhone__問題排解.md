    > I figured it out. It turns out the the aftermarket screens have a plastic lip on the inside near the vibrate motor. And the motor hits it. If you look at your original apple screen you will see the difference

    > I had the exact same issue. Very stupid of me. The replacement screen had a piece of protective cling plastic (blue, in my case) on the inside that I forgot to remove (or rather, didn't even realize I was supposed to remove. It was enough to keep the vibrate motor from moving. As soon as I removed the plastic, it worked just fine.

    > The steel legs on the guard that need to be bent outwards to release the guard in the first place need to be squeezed right back in place if not (especially the one that lays against the vibrate once the screen is re-attached) I found the vibrate hit against it causing it to get stuck.

    > Same problem. This is what fixed it for me: The ear speaker cover was the culprit, the metal clip down the left side was bent out slightly on the new screen (I bought a screen with ear speaker/camera attached). I took off the ear speaker cover, cut off the bit that was in the way with scissors lol then screwed it back on. Vibration works perfectly now!!
