## 文字 DevOpts (Literate DevOps)

- [Literate DevOps](http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops.html)

    > Maintaining servers falls into two phases:
    > 
    > 1.  Bang head until server works
    > 2.  Capture effort into some automation tool like Puppet or Chef.
    > 
    > Recently, I’ve been playing around with making the first phase closer to the second. For lack of a better word, I’m calling it _literate devops_.
