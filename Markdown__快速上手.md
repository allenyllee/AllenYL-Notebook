# Markdown__快速上手

<!-- toc --> 
[toc]

## Usage

### File Path, URL

###### tags: `whitespace`
- [Spaces in path to image file · Issue #54 · alanshaw/markdown-pdf](https://github.com/alanshaw/markdown-pdf/issues/54)

    > [Spaces are illegal in URLs](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-writing).  
[Encode it to `%20`](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/497908/is-a-url-allowed-to-contain-a-space)?

### Comment

- [syntax - Comments in Markdown - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4823468/comments-in-markdown)

    ```
    [//]: # (This may be the most platform independent comment)
    ```

    It may also be prudent to insert a blank line before and after this type of comments, because some Markdown parsers may not like link definitions brushing up against regular text.
