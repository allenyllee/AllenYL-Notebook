    > CACTUs: an unsupervised learning algorithm that learns to learn tasks constructed from unlabeled data. Leads to significantly more effective downstream learning & enables few-shot learning *without* labeled meta-learning datasets [https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02334 ](https://t.co/3XZi9AONTn "https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02334") w/ [~~@~~**kylehkhsu**](https://twitter.com/kylehkhsu), [~~@~~**svlevine**](https://twitter.com/svlevine)
