    > Deluge 真的是很好用的東西，之前就說要寫起來，結果拖到現在才寫:p
    > 
    > 而且還有提供webui 的介面，所以真的很方便。
    > 
    > 1.啟動 Deluge Server
    > 
    > #deluged &
    > 
    > 2.將Deluge 啟動成 Web介面(不啟動 GUI)

    > #deluge -u web &

    > 或是
    > 
    > #deluge -u webui &
    > 
    > 啟動好以後，開瀏覽器連接 http://localhost:8112 就可以連線到Deluge的web介面了

    > The first 3 setting affect rotation as another user stated. However, I felt more clarification is needed, as it didn't really answer for me what each one setting actually means. At the end I also have a further question that I still need further clarification on, and hope someone can help. So here goes:
    > 
    > Under the Seeding section in the Queue Category:
    > 
    > The first 3 settings are basically if/or statements to decide on whether or not to have a torrent active or queued, by:
    > 
    > **Share Ratio Limit:** *This one is straightforward for most people, but is basically states if the ratio of seeding/downloaded in size reaches this then place torrent into queued status*
    > 
    > **Seed Time Ratio:** *This one was not originally very clear to me, but I found out from another forum it basically means, if time seeding/time downloaded >= this amount, then set torrent to queued status Example, if it takes 10 minutes to download a torrent, and you have this set at 7.00, then the torrent will seed for roughly 70 minutes (70/10 = 7) before going to queued status.*
    > 
    > **Seed Time (m):** *This is also pretty straight forward, and means if a torrent has seeded for x minutes, then place to queued status.*
    > 
    > Setting any of these of course to -1 bypasses that test on the torrent.
    > 
    > **Stop seeding when share ratio reaches:** Means the torrent will stop altogether after it has reached this limit.
    > 
    > **Remove Torrent when share ratio reached** -- *This is the one I need more help on. Does it remove the torrent from Deluge, or from Deluge and the computer? If it's the latter is their a way to stop it from doing that?*
