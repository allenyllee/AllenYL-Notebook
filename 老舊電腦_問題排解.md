    > Yes, PCIe 3.0 is backward-compatible with all prior PCIe implementations.

    > However, because PCIe 1.0 maxes out at 2.5 gigatransfers per second (GT/s) vs. PCIe 3.0's 8 GT/s, your video card may not perform as well as you would expect when installed in a PCIe 1.0 slot.

    > There would likely be some loss of performance, but not much. Have a look at this link. Using a much more powerful card (a GTX 680), the loss of performance in a x16 1.1 slot compared to a x16 3.0 slot is only about 4-5% at 1080p. With your weaker card, the loss in performance would be even less, so you're good to go.
