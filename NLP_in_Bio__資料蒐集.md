## [1503.05140] ProtVec: A Continuous Distributed Representation of Biological Sequences

- [[1503.05140] ProtVec: A Continuous Distributed Representation of Biological Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05140)

    > In this method, we adopt artificial neural network approaches and represent a protein sequence with a single dense n-dimensional vector. To evaluate this method, we apply it in classification of 324,018 protein sequences obtained from Swiss-Prot belonging to 7,027 protein families, where an average family classification accuracy of 93%+-0.06% is obtained, outperforming existing family classification methods.
